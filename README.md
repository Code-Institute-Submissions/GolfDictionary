# Golftionary

Welcome to the ReadMe for the Golftionary. The site is a community driven resource for new and experienced players to learn more about the game of golf. At the moment functionality is basic, with the next goal to add being a coaching section for people to post videos and tips to help people improve.
 
## UX

The design scope of this site was determined by the creator to be making the information as accessible as possible.

The design of this website was designed to be relatively simple, so that the users could easily navigate the site and access the information they need.

The defintions page is laid out using mason cards.

## User Stories

### New Visitor

When entering the site the first piece of information that the user comes to is an explanation of what the site does and the information available to them.

Then using the links provided the user can then go onto the list of definitons and find out the infomration they are looking for.

### Registered Visitor

I am a user who has been to the site before and has some new information that I wish to add to the site. So I visit the site and use the link provided to login, I know this has been successful because of the message which flashes up and the login button changes to a logout button.

## Features

The main two features of the page are the definitions section and then the editing forms.

The definitions page has the definitons laid out in in cards with the picture on top. If no picture is associated with the entry then a default image is shown instead. From there you can click on the view button to view more information and access the edit definition button.

### Future Features

The next thing I would add would be a user page where you could edit or delete your account, with the end goal being able to see what actions you have taken out on the site.

## Technologies

* Bootstrap 4 was used to make the structure of the page. This also helps with the responsiveness of the design.
* MongoDB was used to host the database. This was chosen instead of SQL since not all the entries may be complete, so they will have different fields.

## Testing

The login function was tested manually. If you would like to test it wihtout registering please use the Username: NickStevens and the Password: test

Or feel free to register your own account, the passwords are hashed but please use a unique password and a fake email address.

CSS code was validated using https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/
