At the moment functionality is basic, with the next goal to add being a coaching section for people to post videos and tips to help people improve.
 
## UX

The deisgn of this website was designed to be relatively simple, so that the users could easily navigate the site and access the information they need.

The defintions page is laid out using mason cards.

## User Stories

### New Visitor

When entering the site the first piece of information that the user comes to is an explanation of what the site does and the information available to them.

Then using the links provided the user can then go onto the list of definitons and find out the infomration they are looking for.

### Registered Visitor

If you are registered to the site you can then login and add/edit the definitions on the site.

## Features

The main two features of the page are the definitions section and then the editing forms.

The definitions page has the definitons laid out in in cards with the picture on top. If no picture is associated with the entry then  a default image is shown instead.


## Technologies

* Bootstrap 4 was used to make the structure of the page. This also helps with the responsiveness of the design.
* MongoDB was used to host the database. This was chosen instead of SQL since not all the entries may be complete, so they will have different fields.
